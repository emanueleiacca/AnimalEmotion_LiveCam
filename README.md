# Real-Time Emotion Recognition Using CNN

This project implements a real-time emotion recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model can recognize different emotions from facial expressions captured by your camera.

## Source

The CNN model used in this project is based on the work from the Kaggle notebook: [CNN-Beginner's Pet's Expression Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anshtanwar/cnn-beginners-pet-s-expression-recognition) by Ansh Tanwar. 

## Features

- Real-time emotion recognition from live camera feed.
- Supports multiple emotions: happy, sad, and angry.
- Uses OpenCV for capturing and processing video frames.
- Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model for making predictions.

## Example of how it works
